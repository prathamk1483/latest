                    In Maharashtra, this idol of Siddhivinayak Ganapati is seen in two places. After Mumbai, this beautiful idol is found  at Shri Shretra Waigaon in Amravati district. The history of this Siddhivinayak idol can be traced back to ancient stories where it is mentioned that the Pandavas, during their incognito stay in Virat's kingdom in the Mahabharata, came across this idol. The sight of this idol marked the end of their hidden exile in the forest. During the Mughal period, this idol was buried underground to protect it. The nearby villages of Achalpur, Darapur, and Kholapur were under Mughal control at the time. After several decades, the exact location of the idol was lost, and people longed to have a direct encounter with it. However, the idol remained undiscovered until it suddenly resurfaced in the Ingole family's house in Waigaon. This happened in the 16th century. From then on, a temple was built to honour the idol, and the Ingole family resumed their service to the idol. This tradition continues today, with millions of   devotees visiting to Waigaon to see pray the Ganesh idol.
